## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#7EC4CF) for a calming and trustworthy feel, reflecting the educational content.
- Background color: Light, desaturated blue (#E8F8F9), to provide a clean and non-distracting backdrop.
- Accent color: A slightly darker blue (#5F9EA0), analogous to the primary but distinct enough to highlight calls to action and important information.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, and 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines. 'Inter' will maintain clarity and readability for form inputs and feedback, while 'Space Grotesk' will add a touch of modernism.
- Mobile-first responsive design ensuring optimal viewing experience across various devices.
- Simple and intuitive icons for audio controls and form elements.
- Subtle transitions and loading animations to enhance user experience during form submission and audio playback.
